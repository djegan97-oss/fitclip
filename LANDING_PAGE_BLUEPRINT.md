Your Customers Forget. Your Sales Suffer.

**Typography**: 42px bold, dark navy (#0D1B2A), 120% line height

### Section Subheadline
```
You invest in premium launch monitors and expert fittings, but here's what actually happens...
```

**Typography**: 20px, medium gray (#4A5568), italic

### Pain Points Column (Left Side)

**Visual Treatment**: Each pain point is a card with icon, bold headline, and description

#### Pain Point 1
**Icon**: Brain with question mark (outline style, 48px, #FF6B35)  
**Headline**: "The 48-Hour Memory Cliff"  
**Description**:
```
Golfers leave your shop excited, but within 2 days they can't remember which club 
performed better or why you recommended that shaft. The data that took 90 minutes 
to gather becomes a blur.
```

#### Pain Point 2
**Icon**: Shopping cart with X (outline style, 48px, #FF6B35)  
**Headline**: "Lost Upsells & Accessories"  
**Description**:
```
Without a clear reminder of their fitting results, customers don't buy the 
recommended grips, shafts, or complementary clubs. You're leaving $200-500 per 
fitting on the table.
```

#### Pain Point 3
**Icon**: Door with arrow (outline style, 48px, #FF6B35)  
**Headline**: "The 'Let Me Think About It' Walk-Out"  
**Description**:
```
They say they'll be back, but they never return. You've lost the emotional peak 
moment when they saw their best shot of the day. That window closes fast.
```

#### Pain Point 4
**Icon**: Chart declining (outline style, 48px, #FF6B35)  
**Headline**: "Wasted Marketing Investment"  
**Description**:
```
Each fitting costs you time, expertise, and opportunity cost. When customers 
don't convert, you've essentially paid $100-150 in labor for zero return.
```

### Visual Element (Right Column)
**Image Description**: Professional photo or illustration showing:
- A golfer looking confused while holding papers (printout of fitting data)
- Crumpled or forgotten fitting reports
- Subtle metaphor of "information slipping away"

**Image Treatment**: Rounded corners (12px), subtle shadow, 600px max width

**Callout Box** (overlaid on bottom of image):
**Background**: Semi-transparent white (90% opacity)  
**Content**:
```
Industry Research: 60% of golfers can't recall their fitting 
recommendations 1 week later.
```

---

#### FAQ 1
**Q**: How long does setup take?

**A**:
```
FitClip integrates with your launch monitor in under 10 minutes. Our technical 
support team handles the entire setup via a screenshare call. Most shops are 
recording their first fitting within 30 minutes of signing up.

We support TrackMan, Foresight, FlightScope, TopTracer, and 20+ other systems. 
If you have a launch monitor, we can integrate it.
```

---

#### FAQ 2
**Q**: Do my fitters need to do anything different?

**A**:
```
Nope. FitClip runs completely in the background. Your fitters conduct the 
fitting exactly as they always have—no cameras to position, no recording 
buttons to press, no extra steps.

The system automatically captures everything and generates the video after 
the session ends. Your team won't even notice it's running.
```

---

#### FAQ 3
**Q**: What if my launch monitor isn't supported?

**A**:
```
We support 95% of launch monitors on the market, including TrackMan, Foresight 
GCQuad, FlightScope, TopTracer Range, Uneekor, and many more.

If you're using a less common system, contact our team. We've successfully 
integrated with dozens of proprietary setups and can likely support yours too.
```

---

#### FAQ 4
**Q**: How much does it really increase conversions?

**A**:
```
Our average shop sees a 20-30% lift in conversion rates within the first 60 
days. Some shops report even higher increases (our best performer went from 
38% to 72%).

We track this data in your dashboard and will show you the exact ROI. If you 
don't see measurable improvement within 60 days, we refund your money under 
our guarantee.
```

---

#### FAQ 5
**Q**: Can customers share the videos on social media?

**A**:
```
Yes! In fact, 73% of customers share their FitClip videos on Instagram, 
Facebook, or Twitter. Each video is branded with your shop's logo and contact 
info, so every share becomes free advertising.

You can enable one-click social sharing or disable it if you prefer. You're 
in complete control.
```

---

#### FAQ 6
**Q**: What if I have multiple locations?

**A**:
```
The Unlimited plan includes support for up to 3 locations at no extra charge. 
For larger chains or franchises, our Enterprise plan offers unlimited locations 
with centralized management and reporting.

You'll have a single dashboard to see performance across all locations, with 
the ability to drill down into individual shops.
```

---

#### FAQ 7
**Q**: Is there a contract or can I cancel anytime?

**A**:
```
All plans are month-to-month with no long-term contract required. You can 
cancel at any time with one click in your dashboard.

We earn your business every month by delivering results, not by locking you 
into a contract. That said, 96% of shops that start with FitClip are still 
using it 12 months later.
```

---

#### FAQ 8
**Q**: How do the purchase links work?

**A**:

FitClip integrates with your existing e-commerce platform, POS system, or 
website. When a customer clicks "Buy Now" in their video, they're taken 
directly to your checkout page with the recommended clubs pre-loaded.

We support Shopify, WooCommerce, Square, and custom integrations. Setup takes 
about 15 minutes.

We take privacy seriously. Customer videos are stored securely and only

Customers can request deletion of their videos at any time, and we automatically 
delete videos after 2 years unless the customer opts to keep them longer.

Yes. Every plan includes access to our video training library and documentation.

## COPY GUIDELINES

### Tone of Voice
- **Professional yet friendly**: We're experts, but we're not stuffy
- **Data-driven but accessible**: Use numbers and stats, but explain them clearly
- **Confident without arrogance**: We know our solution works, but we're not pushy
- **Benefit-focused**: Always lead with "what's in it for them"

### Writing Style
- **Active voice**: "FitClip increases conversions" not "Conversions are increased"
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max for body copy
- **Concrete specifics**: "20% increase" beats "significant improvement"
- **Second person**: "Your shop" not "A shop" or "The shop"

### Reading Level
- Target 8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid score 60-70)
- Avoid jargon unless it's golf-specific terminology your audience uses
- Explain technical concepts in simple terms

### SEO Keywords (Natural Integration)
Primary keywords to include organically:
- "golf club fitting"
- "golf fitting video"
- "launch monitor integration"
- "golf fitting software"
- "personalized golf fitting"
- "golf shop sales software"

Secondary keywords:
- "TrackMan integration"
- "club fitting technology"
- "golf swing video"
- "golf fitting conversion"
- "golf shop CRM"

### Scannability Best Practices
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Bold key phrases (but don't overdo it)
- Use subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs
- Keep line length readable (60-80 characters)
- Use whitespace generously

---

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Mobile-First Design
- All sections must work on 375px width minimum
- Hero CTA buttons stack vertically on mobile
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu
- Videos resize responsively (maintain 16:9 ratio)
- Touch targets minimum 44px×44px
- Forms use mobile-optimized inputs (number pad for phone, etc.)

### Performance Optimization
- **Above-the-fold load time**: Target <2 seconds
- Hero image: WebP format, 1920px max width, lazy load below fold
- Videos: Use thumbnail with click-to-play (don't autoplay)
- Fonts: Preload critical fonts, subset to used characters
- Images: Lazy load everything below fold, use srcset for responsive images
- Critical CSS: Inline above-the-fold styles

### Form Integration
- Email capture: Integrate with major ESPs (Mailchimp, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign)
- CRM sync: Support Salesforce, Pipedrive, HubSpot
- Payment processing: Stripe recommended
- Calendar booking: Calendly or similar for demo scheduling

### Analytics Tracking
Essential events to track:
- Page view
- Scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Video play starts
- CTA button clicks (tag each CTA separately)
- Pricing card interactions
- FAQ expansions
- Form submissions
- Exit intent

### A/B Testing Elements
**Priority tests to run**:
1. **Hero headline**: Test problem-focused vs. benefit-focused
2. **Primary CTA**: "Start Free Trial" vs. "See Demo First" vs. "Calculate My ROI"
3. **Pricing anchor**: Show per-fit cost vs. monthly cost first
4. **Social proof placement**: Above vs. below features section
5. **Video auto-play**: Thumbnail vs. auto-play (muted)

### Browser/Device Support
- Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (last 2 versions)
- iOS Safari 12+
- Android Chrome 90+
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1
- All images have descriptive alt text
- Videos have captions/transcripts
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- ARIA labels on icons and icon-buttons
- Screen reader friendly semantic HTML

### Security
- HTTPS only (enforce)
- CSP headers configured
- Form validation client and server-side
- Rate limiting on form submissions
- Honeypot fields for spam prevention

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION NOTES

### Psychological Triggers Used
1. **Social Proof**: Testimonials, customer counts, stats throughout
2. **Authority**: Launch monitor partnerships, press logos
3. **Scarcity**: "Price increases next month" on Unlimited tier
4. **Loss Aversion**: Highlight what shops lose without solution
5. **Reciprocity**: Free trial, free demo, free consultation
6. **Consistency**: Multiple small commits (watch video → try free → subscribe)

### User Journey Mapping
**Primary Path (Shop Owner)**:
1. Land on hero → Resonate with pain points
2. See solution overview → Understand core value
3. View testimonials/social proof → Build trust
4. Check pricing → See ROI potential
5. Read FAQ → Remove objections
6. Start free trial → Low-risk conversion

**Secondary Path (Curious Researcher)**:
1. Land on hero → Scroll to features
2. Watch demo video → Understand product
3. Read how it works → See implementation ease
4. Check pricing → Calculate ROI
5. Schedule demo call → High-touch conversion

### Exit Intent Strategy
When user shows exit intent, trigger modal with:
- Headline: "Wait! Before You Go..."
- Offer: "Get our free guide: '7 Ways to Increase Club Fitting Conversions'"
- Form: Name + Email only
- Secondary CTA: "No thanks, I'll miss out"

### Retargeting Segments
1. **Visited pricing but didn't convert**: Show testimonial ads
2. **Watched demo video**: Show limited-time offer
3. **Read FAQs**: Show guarantee/risk-reversal message
4. **Added to cart (enterprise)**: Direct sales outreach
